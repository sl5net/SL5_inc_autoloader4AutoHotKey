# SL5_inc_autoloader4AutoHotKey
copies adapted include files into projects / subfolder. alpha version. usage for your own risk

created because i want to use for my projects some other ahks.

convention is that the have the postfic .inc.ahk and saved in the root/parent folder.

the script reads the files in the subfolders from the parent. 
reads the include command and copies the includes from root folder into the project folder.
it modifies the inc.ahk files if there are also include statements inside.

hope you enjoy it :) best regards se
